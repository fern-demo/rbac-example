## Our Billing Philosophy

We believe in transparent, fair, and value-based pricing that grows with your business. Our philosophy is built on three core principles:

1. **Transparency First**: No hidden fees or surprise charges. What you see is what you get.
2. **Value-Based Scaling**: Pay for what you use, with clear upgrade paths as your needs grow.
3. **Customer Success**: We align our pricing with your success - the more value you get, the more you can grow.

We've designed our pricing plans to be simple and straightforward, making it easy for you to choose the right plan for your needs.
